This **`PiezoResistive Property Calculator (prpcalc)`** computes key parameters of `piezoresistive properties` and comprises two main modules.

**Carrier concentration module**: Based on first-principles density-of-states (DOS) data, it solves for the intrinsic carrier concentration and the corresponding Fermi level.

**Piezoresistive performance module**: It generates `tensile/compressive or shear strained structures` and, in conjunction with first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, computes the `elastoresistance coefficient`, `piezoresistive coefficient`, and `strain sensitivity factor (gauge factor)`.

The program is intended for materials with **cubic crystal symmetry**, and the underlying methodology can be extended to more complex crystal systems.
